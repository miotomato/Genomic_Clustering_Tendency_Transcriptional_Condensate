# Transcription Factor Genomic Clustering and Transcriptional Condensate Analysis

This repository contains scripts for analyzing transcription factor (TF) motif and binding site clustering, chromatin accessibility, and phase-separated transcriptional condensates. The analyses cover cluster propensity (CP) calculations, enrichment at super-enhancers (SEs), chromatin interaction analyses, and survival analyses.
