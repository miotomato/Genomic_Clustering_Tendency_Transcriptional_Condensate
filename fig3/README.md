AICAP_vs_TFBS_CP.py
- Calculates the relationship between the liquid-liquid phase separation potential (AICAP) of transcription factor (TF) proteins and the Cluster Propensity (CP) of TF binding sites (TFBS) within each cell type.
- The correlation between AICAP and TFBS CP is visualized in, shown in Figure 3a.

summarize_plot.py
- Summarizes the TF binding profiles across different cell types to assess clustering tendencies and phase separation potential.
- Plots the correlation between AICAP scores and TFBS CP across multiple cell types, shown in Figure 3b.
- Groups all TFBS into four quartiles based on their TFBS CP and compares AICAP scores among these quartiles to illustrate the relationship between clustering and condensate formationm shown in Figure 3c.
